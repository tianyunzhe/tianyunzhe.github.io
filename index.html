        Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have brought tremendous gains in signal modulation classification. However, DL-based classifiers lack transparency and interpretability, which raises concern about model's reliability and hinders the wide deployment in real-word applications. While explainable methods have recently emerged, little has been done to explain the DL-based signal modulation classifiers.<br><br> 
        
        In this work (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10460345">Tian et al, TR'24</a>), we propose a novel model-agnostic explainer, Model-Agnostic Signal modulation classification Explainer (MASE), which provides explanations for the predictions of black-box modulation classifiers. With the subsequence-based signal interpretable representation and in-distribution local signal sampling, MASE learns a local linear surrogate model to derive a class activation vector, which assigns importance values to the timesteps of signal instance. Besides, the constellation-based explanation visualization is adopted to spotlight the important signal features relevant to model prediction. We furthermore propose the first generic quantitative explanation evaluation framework for signal modulation classification to automatically measure the faithfulness, sensitivity, robustness, and efficiency of explanations. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets with four black-box signal modulation classifiers. The quantitative results indicate MASE outperforms two state-of-the-art methods with 44.7% improvement in faithfulness, 30.6% improvement in robustness, and 44.1% decrease in sensitivity. Through qualitative visualizations, we further demonstrate the explanations of MASE are more human interpretable and provide better understanding into the reliability of black-box model decisions.

        <h4><u>AI Robustness:</u> Robust Reinforcement Learning via Progressive Task Sequence</h4>
    </div>
    <img width="450" src="works/IJCAI.png" align="left" style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px">
    <p>  Robust reinforcement learning (RL) has been a challenging problem in reliable aspects due to the gap between laboratory simulation and real world. Existing efforts typically address the robust RL problem by solving a maxmin problem, which maximizes the cumulative reward under the worst-possible perturbations. However, the worst-case formulation either leads to overly conservative solutions or unstable training process, which further affects the policy robustness. <br><br> 

      Motivated by this, in our recent work (<a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0051.pdf">Li and Tian et al, IJCAI'23</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9837021">Li and Tian et al, TST'22</a>, and  <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/auto-draft-98/">Tian et al, AutoSec'21</a>), we tackle this problem from both formulation definition and algorithm design. First, we formulate the robust RL as a max-expectation optimization problem, where the goal is to an optimal policy under both the worst cases and the non-worst cases. Then, we propose a novel framework DRRL to solve this max-expectation optimization problem, in which a task generation and sequencing mechanism is introduced to iteratively output new tasks at the appropriate level of difficulty for the current policy. With these progressive tasks, we realize multi-task learning to improve policy robustness and training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRRL exhibits significant performance on the unmanned CarRacing game and multiple high-dimensional MuJoCo environments.  </p>

        <h4><u>Brain-inspired Computing:</u> Towards Label-Efficient Aging-related Bug Prediction with Spiking  Convolutional Neural Networks</h4>

      Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have enhanced Aging-Related Bug (ARB) prediction for mitigating software aging. However, DL-based ARB prediction models face a dual challenge: overcoming overfitting to enhance generalization and managing the high labeling costs associated with extensive data requirements. <br><br> 
      
      To address the first issue, in our recent work (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10852596/">Tian et al, TETC'25</a>, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10301319">Tian et al, ISSREW'23</a>), we utilize the sparse and binary nature of spiking communication in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which inherently provides brain-inspired regularization to effectively alleviate overfitting. Therefore, we propose a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN)-based ARB prediction model along with a training framework that handles the model’s spatial-temporal dynamics and non-differentiable nature. To reduce labeling costs, we introduce a Bio-inspired and Diversity-aware Active Learning framework (BiDAL), which prioritizes highly informative and diverse samples, enabling more efficient usage of the limited labeling budget. This framework incorporates bio-inspired uncertainty to enhance informativeness measurement along with using a diversity-aware selection strategy based on clustering to prevent redundant labeling. Experiments on three ARB datasets show that ARB-SCNN effectively reduces overfitting, improving generalization performance by 6.65% over other DLbased classifiers. Additionally, BiDAL boosts label efficiency for ARB-SCNN training, outperforming four state-of-the-art active learning methods by 4.77% within limited labeling budgets.

          <h4>Mitigating Overfitting for Deep Learning-based Aging-related Bug Prediction via Brain-inspired Regularization</h4>

      <p> To alleviate the impact of software aging, primarily induced by aging-related bugs (ARBs), ARB prediction has drawn considerable interest from both academia and industry. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have brought tremendous gains in ARB prediction. However, due to the limited size and extreme class imbalance in ARB datasets, conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) are susceptible to overfitting, resulting in a suboptimal generalization performance. <br><br> 
        
        
        In this paper (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10301319">Tian et al, ISSREW'23</a>), we take advantage of sparse and binary nature of spiking communication in spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently provides a brain-inspired regularization to effectively alleviate overfitting. We propose the first spiking convolutional neural network-based ARB prediction model (ARB-SCNN), comprising a spiking encoder followed by a classifier and utilizing the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron as the basic spiking computing unit. Considering the spatial-temporal dynamics and the non-differentiability nature, we develop a dedicated training framework for ARB-SCNN, which incorporates the rate coding-based mean square error (MSE) loss and employs the backpropagation through time with the surrogate gradient. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world ARB datasets demonstrate that our ARB-SCNN effectively mitigates overfitting, improving generalization performance by 7.82% compared to the state-of-the-art DL-based classifiers, and it exhibits up to 5× better computational energy efficiency.

          Network data such as socialnet, becomes an important component in real life, drawing a lot of study issues of security and safety. Recently, adversarial attacks on GNN (Graph Neural Network) are exposed. By generating unnoticeable adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, the performance of GNN is greatly dropped on graph-related tasks such as node classification, link prediction and community detection.<br><br>
          
          Existing automatic attack methods are developed for per-node attacks, which can only be utilized for multi-node attacks in a sequential way. However, due to the overlook of perturbation influence between different per-node attacks, existing sequential method does not guarantee a global attack success rate for all target nodes, under a fixed budget of perturbation. Motivated by this, we propose a parallel adversarial attack framework on node classification (<a href="https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/6631247.pdf">Tian et al, SCN'21</a>). Firstly, based on FGA and NETTACK, we redesign new loss function and objective function aimed at multi-target parallel adversarial attack, and propose node filtering-based P-FGA and P-NETTACK. Then, through constructing intersection and supplement mechanisms of perturbations, we integrate P-FGA and P-NETTACK in a unified framework, finally realizing effective parallel adversarial attacks.<br><br>

        <p> Due to the gap between lab simulation and real world, robust reinforcement learning has been a challenging problem. Existing efforts approached this problem through performing random environmental perturbation in learning process. However, one cannot guarantee perturbation is positive. Bad ones might bright failures to reinforcement learning. </p>
		<p>In our recent work, we treat robust reinforcement learning as a multi-task reinforcement learning problem, and propose a curricular robust reinforcement learning approach (<a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/autosec2021_23011_paper.pdf">Tian et al, AutoSec'21</a>).

        <p> Adversarial example, an input that is modified slightly to cause a machine learning system to produce erroneous outputs, has seen significant studies recently.</p>
		<p> Unfortunately, the fine data perturbation of adversarial examples ignores to keep potential data correlations between feature pairs. Thus, such adversarial examples will be easily filtered by configuring data correlations as basic filtering rules.</p>
		<p>We propose an advanced robust adversarial example generation attack, avoiding not to be filtered as well as causing false classification (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359196">Tian et al, ICPADS'20</a>). We first define four basic data correlations called strict linear constraint, approximate linear constraint, addition boundary constraint and zero multiplication constraint. Then, based on embedding multiple data correlations into one constraint matrix from the Pearson analysis, our approach can enable a Hadamard product of the constraint matrix and the sign of gradient matrix to craft perturbations, keeping consistent data correlations. Experimental results on intrusion detection system demonstrate the superiority of our constraint-based adversarial example generation, especially in terms of keeping data constraints. </p>
